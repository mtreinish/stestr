Guidelines for contribution are documented at: http://stestr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guidelines.html

Use `github pull requests`_ to submit patches. Before you submit a pull request
ensure that all the automated testing will pass by running `tox` locally. This
will run the test suite and also the automated style rule checks just as they
will in CI. If CI fails on your change it will not be able to merge.
