IMPROVEMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``failing`` now correctly calls ``repository.get_failing`` and will this
  track all seen failures rather than just the latest observed failures.

* New argument type ``StringArgument`` for use when a supplied argument is just
  a string, rather than a typed argument.

* New subcommand 'failing' added.

* New subcommand ``run`` added which reads a .testr.conf file to figure out how
  to run tests with subunit output. It then runs them and pipes into testr
  load. This allows simpler integration and permits a programming interface so
  that tools like Tribunal/Eclipe etc can refresh tests in a testrepository.
  ``run`` also passes arguments and options down to the child process.

* The command 'last' will no longer error on a new repository.
