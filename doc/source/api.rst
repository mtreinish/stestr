Internal API Reference
======================
This document serves as a reference for the python API used in stestr. It should
serve as a guide for both internal and external use of stestr components via
python. The majority of the contents here are built from internal docstrings
in the actual code.

Internal APIs
-------------

The modules in this list do not necessarily have any external api contract,
they are intended for internal use inside of stestr. If anything in these
provides a stable contract and is intended for usage outside of stestr it
will be noted in the api doc.
